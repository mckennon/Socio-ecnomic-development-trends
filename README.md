# Socio-ecnomic-development-trends
For my final capstone project I looked at the socio-econmic development data that I downloaded off kaggle. This was sourced by the UN. The 
data set contains 66 countries from aorund the world with 99 variables that effect development status. The goal was to find what are the defining 
characteristics of developing countries.
